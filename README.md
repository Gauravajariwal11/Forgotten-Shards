# Forgotten-Shards
“Forgotten Shards” is a mystery game that requires the user to visit different locations across the UTA campus in order to advance in the game. The player acts in the role of a student assistant in the history department who receives messages from a deceased former student, asking the player to help find an old amulet. Additionally, the player receives location hints, which tell the player where to go next. Once arrived at the physical location, a quest will appear on the screen. Quests can be either word riddles, math riddles, or hidden object games. Upon successful completion, the player receives a hint for what the ghost’s amulet looks like and another location hint. At the end of the game, the player will be able to select the correct amulet from a set of similar-looking amulets to complete the game.
